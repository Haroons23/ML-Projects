The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and we want to be the best real estate company in the area. To compete with our peers, we decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist us and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. 

We have the Boston Housing dataset at our disposal. It contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. 
 
We created a model to estimate the best selling price for our clients' homes.
